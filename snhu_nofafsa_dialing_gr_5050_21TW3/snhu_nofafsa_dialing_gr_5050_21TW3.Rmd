## Overview `r fontawesome::fa("binoculars")`
<br>

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("imgs/nofafsa_test_summary.png"))
```

<br>

__Theory:__  One of the biggest impediments to students who plan on using financial aid is their inability to quickly complete the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) as part of the admission process.  

__Hypothesis:__ Outreaching students who have not completed their FAFSA *increases* their likelihood to complete their FAFSA.
<br>
<br>


## Test Design `r fontawesome::fa("flask")`
<br>

__Test Metric:__ FAFSA Completion Rate, calculated as:
$$FAFSA Completion Rate  = \sum_{n=FAFSA Complete} / \sum_{n=Total Eligible to Complete FAFSA}$$

__Testing Groups:__ Of all eligible members of the population (full criteria list below), control and experiment groups were assigned according to testing cells on the Unify contact.

+ Control Group: **50%** of eligible dialing list - these were *not dialed*
+ Experiment Group: **50%** of eligible dialing list - these were *dialed*

Those in the experiment group were dialed weekly throughout the experiment timeframe with the exception of the final week prior to term start.

**Experiment Population Eligibility (AKA InPopulation):**

+ GR prospective student with open Admission opportunity for the 21TW3 term 
+ In Applied, App In Progress or Accepted Stage 
+ Has not completed a 20/21 FAFSA or has only completed the "wrong" FAFSA year (only completed 21-22 FAFSA form and must complete 20-21)
+ Prospective students that have not indicated their sole financial plan as being "Out of Pocket" or there is no financial plan indicated.
+ Is not Course-Work Only (CWO) or a Guild student

<br>

## Outcomes & Learnings `r fontawesome::fa("chart-bar")`

### Experiment Results

+ __Overall Results:__ As of 2/22/21, the FAFSA completion rate for the test group was **1.2 percentage points lower (-4.8% change)**. This difference is not statistically significant at 95% confidence.

+ __Reg Rate:__ The InPopulation to reg rate (# of regs / # of InPopulation) was nearly flat at **0.1 percentage points lower** for the test group versus the control. Out of those that completed a FAFSA, the reg rate was **0.3 percentage points higher** for the test group versus the control. Neither of these differences are statistically significant.

### Learnings

+ __Wrong FAFSA:__ Those that originally submitted the wrong FAFSA (filled out 21-22 instead of 20-21) completed a FAFSA **more than three times** the rate (**72%** vs. **23%**) of anyone else in the population who did not fill out a FAFSA, but there was very little difference between test and control groups.  This indicates that those prospective students who are engaged enough to complete one version of the FAFSA (albeit the "wrong" one), will complete the correct FAFSA on their own and appear unlikely to be influenced by outreach campaigns like this one.  For reference, note that Undergrad "Wrong FAFSA" students only completed their FAFSAs at a rate of about two times higher than the rest of the population:  [No FAFSA UG Dialing 21EW3 Experiment](file://millyard.snhu.edu/Data/DataWebServices/SNHU%20Metrics/Analytics/HTML/remap-nofafsa_dialing_ug_21EW3-20201114.html)]

+ __Enrolls Without FAFSA:__ **17.3%** of all enrollments that occurred within this population (Control + Experiment) enrolled without completing a FAFSA

### Next Steps
__*Additional Experimentation.*__
